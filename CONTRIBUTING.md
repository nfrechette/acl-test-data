# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in the ACL test data! All contributions that follow our guidelines below and abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are welcome.

# Getting set up

See the [development setup](./docs/development_setup.md) section for details on how to generate project solutions, build, and run.

Every pull request should trigger continuous integration on every platform we support and they will also execute the unit tests automatically.

The project roadmap for the next few milestones is tracked with [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-test-data/issues).

Whether you create an issue or a pull request, I will do my best to comment or reply within 48 hours.

# Contributions we are looking for

Several issues already have a [help wanted](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-gltf/labels/help%20wanted) label. Issues with the label [Good first issue](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-test-data/labels/good%20first%20issue) are tasks that should be either reasonably simple. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.

Feature requests are welcome providing that they fit within the project scope. For smaller features, you are welcome to create an issue with as much relevant information as you can. If it makes sense, I will prioritize it or add it to the backlog, and if I feel it is beyond the scope of the project, I will tell you why and close the issue.

If you aren't sure, don't be afraid to reach out by email!
